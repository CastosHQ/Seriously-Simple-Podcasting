Podcasting the way it's meant to be. No mess, no fuss - just you and your content taking over the world.

== Description ==
Seriously Simple Podcasting is a top-rated podcasting plugin for WordPress for beginners and power-users built by [Castos](http://castos.com/podcast-hosting-wordpress). Using our straight-forward set up instructions, advanced features, and plenty of customization options, Seriously Simple Podcasting powers over 20K+ podcasts.

The plugin will *always* remain free to use. The only costs associated with using Seriously Simple Podcasting is if you choose to host your audio files with a dedicated podcast hosting provider. Similar to using a website hosting provider to keep your WordPress site fast and running smoothly, we recommend hosting podcast files with a dedicated provider. But remember, this isn't required!

Every plugin feature is fully functional no matter who you choose as your podcast hosting provider. Seriously Simple Podcasting gives you more control over your content so you can start podcasting without limits.

However, Castos is specifically designed to sync with Seriously Simple Podcasting to save you time.  This means anytime you update your podcast's information or upload a new episode file, the changes automatically sync with your Castos hosting account. You only have to do the action once, saving hours each week. Read more about how [Castos and Seriously Simple Podcasting work together](https://castos.com/how-castos-and-seriously-simple-podcasting-work-together/).

With other podcast providers, you'll need to make updates to your podcast's RSS feed via your hosting provider account and again on WordPress to manually sync the information. Seriously Simple Podcasting is also unable to read a few metadata fields (like episode duration and publish date) from 3rd party hosting providers. For each episode, you'll manually add that information as well.

**HOW TO SET UP SERIOUSLY SIMPLE PODCASTING**

Getting started with Seriously Simple Podcasting is a seriously simple process. In just four steps, you'll go from installing the plugin to your WordPress site to submitting a functioning RSS feed to every podcast directory.
