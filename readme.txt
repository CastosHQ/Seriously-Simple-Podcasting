An incredibly easy-to-use podcasting plugin.

== Description ==

"Seriously Simple Podcasting" is a simple and easy-to-use podcasting solution for WordPress. It uses a native WordPress interface and has minimal settings so as not to distract you from what you really need to do - publish your content.

It comes with built-in templates, widget and shortcode so you can display your podcast however you like. It also has easy subscribe links for iTunes listeners and standard RSS subscribers.

Podcast episodes are playable directly on your site using the MediaElement.js audio player that works in all browsers: http://mediaelementjs.com/.

UPGRADE NOTICE: Users upgrading to v1.1 must please take note of the feed URL changes (for iTunes feeds and standard RSS feeds). You will find the new feed URLs on the Settings > Podcast page.

== Usage ==

Simply upload the plugin and you're good to go. By going to Settings > Podcast you can set a few simple settings to make your podcast more unique and manageable.

Podcast audio files can be uploaded directly into WordPress or hosted on any other site - in the latter case all you'll need to supply is the URL to the file.
