An incredibly easy-to-use podcasting plugin.

== Description ==

"Seriously Simple Podcasting" is a simple and easy-to-use podcasting solution for WordPress. It uses a native WordPress interface and has minimal settings so as not to distract you from what you really need to do - publish your content.

It comes with built-in templates, widget and shortcode so you can display your podcast however you like. It also has easy subscribe links for iTunes listeners and standard RSS subscribers.

Podcast episodes are playable directly on your site using the MediaElement.js audio player that works in all browsers: http://mediaelementjs.com/.

UPGRADE NOTICE: Users upgrading from v1.1.x must please take note of the change in location of the settings page - you will now find it at Podcast > Settings.

== Usage ==

Simply upload the plugin and you're good to go. Go to Podcast > Add New to add new episodes and go to Podcast > Settings to customise and describe your podcast.

Podcast audio files can be uploaded directly into WordPress or hosted on any other site - in the latter case all you'll need to supply is the URL to the file.

UPGRADE NOTICE: Users upgrading from v1.1.x must please take note of the change in location of the settings page - you will now find it at Podcast > Settings (as opposed Settings > Podcast).

== Installation ==

Installing "Seriously Simple Podcasting" can be done either by searching for "Seriously Simple Podcasting" via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org
1. Upload the ZIP file through the 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' screen in your WordPress dashboard
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Customise the plugin from its settings page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've installed the plugin and added episodes, but where do I find all of it on my website? =

Your podcast page will always be available from this URL on your site: http://www.example.com/?post_type=podcast, but if you go to the plugin's settings page (Podcast > Settings) you can specify a URL slug that will make your podcast URLs more attractive - once you have saved your slug, the podcast archive page URL will be formatted like this: http://www.example.com/your-slug.

= Why do the podcast episode and archive pages just look like my default blog pages? =

On the plugin's settings page (Podcast > Settings) you can opt to use the plugin's built-in templates - they will ensure that your podcast is displayed correctly. They are not guaranteed to fit in with every theme, but you can simply create your own page templates to override them.
