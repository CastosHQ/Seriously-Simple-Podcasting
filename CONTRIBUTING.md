When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below so that we can keep on top of things.

__Note:__

GitHub is for *bug reports and contributions only* - if you have a support question don't post here. Use [the plugin's support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/seriously-simple-podcasting) instead for general support, but make sure to read through the [documentation](http://www.seriouslysimplepodcasting.com/documentation/) first.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.

## Making Changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Clone the forked repository to your local development environment
* Run `npm install`, which will install any npm and composer dependencies, as well as build any block editor assets
* Define the `SCRIPT_DEBUG` constant in your wp-config.php to use the development versions of any JavaScript and CSS assets
* Make the changes to your forked repository.
  * **Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/) for all languages.**
* When committing, reference your issue (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the *develop* branch of the Seriously Simple Podcasting repository.
