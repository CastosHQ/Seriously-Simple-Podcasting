Podcasting the way it's meant to be.

== Description ==

"Seriously Simple Podcasting" is a simple and easy-to-use podcasting solution for WordPress. It uses a native WordPress interface and has minimal settings so as not to distract you from what you really need to do - publish your content.

It comes with built-in templates, widget and shortcode so you can display your podcast however you like. It also has easy subscribe links for iTunes listeners and standard RSS subscribers.

**Primary Features**

- New `podcast` post type and `series` taxonomy for managing your podcast episodes
- Customisable templates for podcast pages
- Highly configurable RSS feed designed for all podcast services, including iTunes
- Widget and shortcode for displaying podcast episodes anywhere on your site
- Playable episodes using the built-in WordPress media player
- Simple settings so you can get your podcast up and running quickly
- Allows audio files to be hosted on the same site or any other server
- Full i18n support

**Some examples of the plugin in action**

== Usage ==

Simply upload the plugin and you're good to go. Go to "Podcast > Add New" to add new episodes and go to "Podcast > Settings" to customise, describe, protect, redirect & share your podcast.

Podcast audio files can be uploaded directly into WordPress or hosted on any other site - in the latter case all you'll need to supply is the URL to the file. Please note that episode lengths can only be calculated for files that are hosted on the same server as the website.

== Installation ==

Installing "Seriously Simple Podcasting" can be done either by searching for "Seriously Simple Podcasting" via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org
1. Upload the ZIP file through the 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' screen in your WordPress dashboard
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Customise the plugin from the 'Podcast > Settings' page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin doesn't work like it should - what's the problem? =

There could be a number of reasons for this, but the most common one is that you have another podcasting plugin activated on your site. Make sure you deactivate any other podcasting plugins (e.g. BluBrry PowerPress, PodPress, etc.). If you have done that and the plugin is still not working as it should then have a read of the rest of the FAQs as well as the support forum - if you don't find what you need there, then create a new topic.

= I've installed the plugin and added episodes, but where do I find all of it on my website? =

Your podcast page will always be available from this URL on your site: http://www.example.com/?post_type=podcast, but if you go to the plugin's settings page (Podcast > Settings) you can specify a URL slug that will make your podcast URLs more attractive - once you have saved your slug, the podcast archive page URL will be formatted like this: http://www.example.com/your-slug.

= Why do the podcast episode and archive pages just look like my default blog pages? =

On the plugin's settings page (Podcast > Settings) you can opt to use the plugin's built-in templates - they will ensure that your podcast is displayed correctly. They are not guaranteed to fit in with every theme, but you can simply create your own page templates to override them. To do this, disable the use of the built-in templates and copy the 'archive-podcast.php' and 'single-podcast.php' files from the plugin's 'templates' directory and paste them into your theme's root folder - from there you can edit them to display the content however you wish.

= How can I edit the actual content of the RSS feed? =

You shouldn't ever need to do this, but if you would like to override the the RSS feed content then copy the 'feed-template.php' file from the plugin's 'templates' directory and paste it into your theme's root folder - from there you can edit it to display the feed content however you wish.

= Why can't I upload an audio file that is larger than 2/8/16/32/XX MB? =

This issue actually has nothing to do with this plugin. Your server and your WordPress installation will each have a maximum file upload size that you are allowed to make use of and there is no way for this plugin to override that. There are a few ways in which you can increase your server's maximum file upload size, but those instructions are outside the scope of this plugin's FAQ.

= Why don't I see the media player when I view the individual episode pages? =

There could be a few reasons for this:

1. Your episode audio file is reference to folder and not a specific file
2. The audio file is password protected
3. Your site is running on an IP address and not a domain name
4. You have one of these plugins installed & activated on your site: 'WP Audio Player' or 'MediaElement.js - HTML5 Video & Audio Player'

If any of these are true for you then that will most likely be the reason that the media player is not showing on your podcast episodes.

= Why does my podcast image not save properly? =

For your podcast image to be valid on iTunes, it must be at least 1400x1400 px. This means that when you upload your image you must make sure to select a size option that at least has those dimensions. The image will display smaller on the plugin's settings screen, but as long as your uploaded image is the correct dimensions and you have selected the right size when inserting it then it will work.

= My feed password does not seem to be saving - what gives? =

Once you have saved a password for your podcast feed you will not see the password on screen again - this is because it is encoded and stored securely. You can enter a different password at any time, but if you save the settings page and you do not want to change the password then simply leave the password field blank and it will not be updated.

= Where can I find documentation/support for this plugin? =

There is currently no documentation for this plugin, but you can post questions on the support forum here: http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/seriously-simple-podcasting - I will respond to topics as I have time to do so, but I can make no guarantees of my availability. Before posting anything on the support forum, please update to the latest version of the plugin.

= I have an idea for this plugin - how can I make it known? =

If you have an idea for the plugin, feel free to post on the support forum [here](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/seriously-simple-podcasting_.
If you would like to contribute to the code then you can fork the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/hlashbrooke/Seriously-Simple-Podcasting) - your pull requests will be reviewed and merged if they fit into the goals for this plugin. All contributors will be given credit where it is due.
