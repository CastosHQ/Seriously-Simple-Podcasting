== Usage ==

Simply upload the plugin and you're good to go. Go to "Podcast > Add New" to add new episodes and go to "Podcast > Settings" to customise your podcast.

Podcast audio files can be uploaded directly into WordPress or hosted on any other site - in the latter case all you'll need to supply is the URL to the file. *Please note that episode lengths and file sizes can only be automatically calculated for files that are hosted on the same server as the website - either way though, you can input them in manually.*
