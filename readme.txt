An incredibly easy-to-use podcasting plugin.

== Description ==

"Seriously Simple Podcasting" is a simple and easy-to-use podcasting solution for WordPress. It uses a native WordPress interface and has minimal settings so as not to distract you from what you really need to do - publish your content.

It comes with built-in templates, widget and shortcode so you can display your podcast however you like. It also has easy subscribe links for iTunes listeners and standard RSS subscribers.

== Usage ==
